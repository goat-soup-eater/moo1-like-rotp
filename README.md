# moo1-like-rotp

MoO1-like RotP Mod is a mod that makes rotp more like moo1. It does several things to accomplish this, including changing the music to the original moo1 tunes (created by David Govett).

# How to install

 - Create a copy of Remnants.jar in a separate folder, to prevent accidental damage to the game, if you are installing the mod for the first time.
 - Open Remnants.jar with an archive tool (WinRar, 7-Zip, etc.)
 - Go to rotp.
 - Extract the downloaded zip file, go to moo1-like-rotp/.
 - Add all the folders inside moo1-like-rotp to the Remnants.jar archive.
 - Go to data/lang/en/races and delete the 10 dialogue files (Alkari.dialogue.txt; Bulrathi.dialogue.txt, etc.)
