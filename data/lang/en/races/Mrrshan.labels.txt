MAIN_ADVISOR_TITLE                | %1 Advisor
MAIN_ADVISOR_BUTTON_OK            | Dismiss
MAIN_ADVISOR_SCOUT                | Ah-ha! Our first fleet is ready! Let's use it to find a world to colonize.
MAIN_ADVISOR_TRANSPORT            | We've taken new territory on %1. The more of us we transport from %3, the faster we'll develop this world.
MAIN_ADVISOR_DIPLOMACY            | We've made contact with a new alien race! Think they'll prove to be strong enemies, or easy pickings?
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_ENGINE          | We've found a way to improve our engines and make our ships even faster! If we incorporate them into our ship designs, our attacks on enemy worlds will become even more efficient!
MAIN_ADVISOR_RALLY_POINTS         | Emperor! War is upon us! Set a rally point to tell our commanders where to centralize the fleets!
MAIN_ADVISOR_MISSILE_BASES        | The rim worlds under our control are vulnerable to enemy attack! Let's construct missile bases to prevent 'em from falling into enemy hands.
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_WEAPON          | We've managed to develop powerful new weapons for use on our ships. These are sure to cause a rout among the forces of our enemies once we include 'em on our ship designs.
MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL              | A meeting of peoples will soon be upon us, but they say it's for diplomacy instead of war. Strange isn't it? Still, we should attend this "Galactic Council", if for nothing else then to placate the more skittish empires.
MAIN_ADVISOR_REBELLION            | Are you feeling unwell, Emperor? There's a rebellion on %1 and you haven't given orders to put 'em down.
MAIN_ADVISOR_RESIST_COUNCIL       | Did they think we'd just lay down and let 'em put a coward's peace over the galaxy like that? Let's strike their worlds, Emperor: our people are itching for a chance to unleash their aggression! 
MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL_RESISTED     | Those rebel fools refuse our ruling! Let's show 'em our dictum: the strong take, the weak give!
