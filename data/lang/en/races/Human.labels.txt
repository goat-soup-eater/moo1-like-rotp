MAIN_ADVISOR_TITLE                | %1 Advisor
MAIN_ADVISOR_BUTTON_OK            | Dismiss
MAIN_ADVISOR_SCOUT                | Our logistics division reports that a pair of scouts and a colony ship are ready for deployment. I suggest we locate and colonize a nearby planet as soon as we can.
MAIN_ADVISOR_TRANSPORT            | The establishment of a colony at %1 was successful. The more transports we use, the faster %1 will develop into a cornerstone of our interstellar empire.
MAIN_ADVISOR_DIPLOMACY            | Emperor, I am thrilled to confirm our first contact with an alien civilization! Please, review our intelligence so that we can begin manipulating these aliens to better serve our ends.
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_ENGINE          | Our propulsion research has yielded a more advanced ship design. Please integrate this breakthrough into all future ships. That's all for now.
MAIN_ADVISOR_RALLY_POINTS         | Our military forces are gearing up for war, but we'll need to mobilize our forces quickly. I recommend using rally points to fold our newly created ships into the fleet as soon as possible.
MAIN_ADVISOR_MISSILE_BASES        | Our strategists worry about the defensive capabilities of worlds at the edge of our territory. They recommend creating missile bases to fortify planetary defenses, and I agree with their assessment.
MAIN_ADVISOR_SHIP_WEAPON          | Our newest research has led to an advancement in weapons technology. You can modify new ship designs to include these weapons at any time from now on.
MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL              | Emperor! A meeting of all interstellar empires will occur in only 5 short years. Direct our diplomats to improve how we are viewed, and we'll utilize our advantages to steer this Galactic Council to our ends.
MAIN_ADVISOR_REBELLION            | I've heard reports that there is a rebellion underway on %1. A rebellion! Of all things! Let's get some boots on the ground and get that colony under control.
MAIN_ADVISOR_RESIST_COUNCIL       | Seems that this'll be our final war one way or the other. I just hope all our past has taught us will be enough to prepare for what lies ahead...
MAIN_ADVISOR_COUNCIL_RESISTED     | Look at those foolish rebels! We've democratically been elected to lead this galaxy forward and all they can think of is war?! Then let's give 'em what they're asking for!
